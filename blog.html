      <h2>Petoskey</h2>
        <p>
          Petoskey is the perfect place for a day trip in Northern Michigan. The perfect walkable city for shopping, and enjoying the view of Little Traverse Bay. In the summer, Petoskey has a fenced area with delicious food truck options that can be enjoyed before you start to walk around. Countless shopping opportunities and art shops will have you entertained for hours as you walk the beautiful streets of Petoskey. A hidden gem in Petoskey is the Petoskey Pretzel Co. Tucked in the side of the wall on a steep decline road is where you’ll find the most delectable pretzels you’ve ever had the pleasure of consuming. Stopping in Petoskey Pretzel Co. is always the last thing you should do before leaving Petoskey.

        <h2>Traverse City</h2>
          <p>
            Traverse City is another beautiful place in Northern Michigan. A great thing about Traverse City is that the sleeping bear dunes are so close by. A great Northern Michigan day would be to start your day hiking and sightseeing at the sleeping bear dunes, and then returning to downtown Traverse city for a dinner to close off the night. The sleeping bear dunes will provide you with a beautiful view of Lake Michigan and a great exercise of walking through all that sand. Downtown Traverse City will be sure to provide all the options you need to enjoy your night and eat a great meal.

          <h2>Charlevoix</h2>
            <p>
              The best part of Charlevoix is that it has lake Charlevoix. Lake Charlevoix is tremendously beautiful, and gets warmer earlier in the year, and stays warmer than lake Michigan. For this reason I would say that if you are going to visit Charlevoix, it’s crucial that you end up in Lake Charlevoix somehow. One good option is always to wade in at Ferry beach, or jump off the pier. Ferry beach is also known to hold events with live music unconventionally facing the water. The perfect way to enjoy these events is to get a tube or any type of flotation and soak in the water and enjoy the music. Charlevoix is also famous for their charming downtown area where you can find all kinds of food, ice cream, and of course fudge. After your trip downtown it’s always pleasant to walk down to the Charlevoix lighthouse pier to enjoy the view of Lake Michigan.

            <h2>Leelanau County</h2>
              <p>
                Leelanau County will give you the perfect feeling of a beautiful up north town that isn’t quite as crowded as the other three locations on this list. In Leelanau County you have plenty of options to enjoy your time. There are countless pristine sightseeing opportunities that overlook the coast over Lake Michigan that you could visit, one of which being the Empire Bluff trail. You could also visit the Historic Fishtown to give yourself a feel for the history of Leelanau. Lastly you could make your way to any number of the sand dune locations that Leelanau has to offer.
